    "## Problem Overview\n",
    "**Bank Telemarketing** is a method of direct marketing in which a salesperson persuades prospective customers to buy products or services over the phone call or through a subsequent face to face. In this project we will focused on the method based on phone calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of customers disturbed by this type of method and resulted affect the relationship between the bank and the customer, especially when they got a continuous phone call in an inappropriate situation suddenly. On the other hand, many salespeople find this method isn't useful because it consumes time with a low chance of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can predict how successfully the telemarketing method on given customers, the bank can saving time, increase the chance of success, and saving costs by reducing the number of the phone call."
